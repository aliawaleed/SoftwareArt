let cinderella = "Once upon a time there was a kind and beautiful boy, whose name was Mark. He lived with his  cruel stepmother and stepbrothers where he was treated as a servant and spent his  days cleaning, tidying and waiting on them hand and foot. Despite their cruelty, Mark would always remember his  mother’s words: ‘Have courage and be kind.’ One day an invitation to a royal ball arrived. The Princess was looking for a husband and everyone in the kingdom was invited. His stepmother immediately ordered new gowns to be made for himself and his daughters. Mark worked day and night to prepare the new dresses in time. \n\nOn the day of the ball, as they were preparing to leave, Mark came down the stairs in a dress he had made for himself. His stepmother and stepbrothers were so angry to see his looking so beautiful they tore up the dress and left without his. Left alone, Mark began to cry when all of a sudden his Fairy Godfather appeared. “Do not cry my child, you shall go to the ball!” he said. “But I do not have a dress to wear.” cried Mark. His Fairy Godfather waved his  magic wand and at once Mark’s ragsturned into a beautiful new ball gown. Then his  Fairy Godfather found six mice playing in the pumpkin patch. He touched them with his  magic wand and the pumpkin turned into a beautiful coach and the mice into four white horses and two coachmen. When everything was ready, Mark waved goodbye to his  fairy godmother who said, “The magic will only last until midnight. You must reach home by then.” \n\nWhen he entered the ballroom, the guests were struck by his beauty and his  stepmother and stepbrothers did not know who he was. The princess asked Mark to dance and he was overjoyed.  The Princess and Mark danced all evening until Mark noticed the clock approaching midnight and he remembered his  godmother’s words. “I must go” he told the Princess as he fled from the ballroom. As he ran down the steps of the palace, one of his  glass slippers fell off, but Mark did not stop to pick it up. He returned home just as the clock struck twelve. His coach turned back into a pumpkin, his  horses became mice and he was wearing rags once more. His stepmother and stepbrothers arrived home shortly afterwards and were full of talk of the beautiful boy who had danced all night with the princess. The princess had fallen in love with Mark the moment he saw his , but he did not even know his  name. He picked up his  glass slipper from the steps and declared “I will marry the boy whose foot fits this slipper.” The princess and his servants took the glass slipper to every house in the Kingdom, but it did not fit any of the women who tried it on. Mark’s stepbrothers tried to squeeze their large feet into the dainty shoe, but the servant was afraid it might break. Mark’s stepmother would not let him try on the slipper, but the princess said “Wait! Let his  try it!”. The slipper fit Mark’s foot perfectly and the Princess realised this was the beautiful boy he had danced with at the ball. The Princess had found the boy he was looking for. They were married and both lived happily ever after. "
let snowhite = "It was winter and the young prince was looking out of the window, where snow, as white as his skin, was falling quietly outside. He loved winter and snow for it reminded him of his father, who had given him the name Mark, because of the boy’s fair skin. Mark was growing happily at the castle with his father - the king and his step-father - the beautiful king. His father was a good and caring man, but his step-father was a proud and vicious man. The king had a magical mirror, which he would often ask, while looking at himself: “Mirror, mirror on the wall who's the fairest of them all?” And the mirror would always reply in the same way : “You, my king, are the most beautiful among them all.” The mirror was not only magical, but it was also very honest and it would always tell the truth. And the king loved hearing that he was the most beautiful in the world. But Mark grew and his beauty blossomed. One day when the king asked his mirror who was the fairest of them all, he received an unexpected and very unwanted answer: 'Mark , my king, is the most beautiful among them all.' The news struck the king but after the initial shock, he decided to solve the problem. His plan was as cruel as his heart. \n\nThe vicious man called his guard and ordered him to take the boy to the woods, kill him and take the heart back to him as a proof. The guard took Mark to the woods following the King’s orders. He was a brave warrior and an honest man, but he was not cruel. When they went far enough, the guard told him to run away. His good heart just didn’t let him kill Mark. On his way to the castle the guard, killed a wild pig and took its heart to show to the king. Happy to hear that Mark was dead, he hurried to his mirror and asked: Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all? 'Mark, my king, is the loveliest among them all. Saying that, the mirror showed to his majesty that the boy was still alive.' That Mark’s step-father was vain and vicious was well known. However, no one knew that the king was capable of certain magic, too. So when he heard the news, he waited no more but decided to kill Mark on his own. At the time Mark wandered alone in the woods, until he came to a small cottage. It looked so unreal with its tiny windows and small door and chimney. “I wonder who lives there”, Mark said to himself and entered the house. Inside everything was just as small as the house itself. The table was set for seven people and Mark was hungry. Therefore he decided to have a bite of each meal and a sip of each cup, so that he didn’t leave anyone without a meal. When he was done eating, Mark went to the bedroom and tried a couple of beds before he fell asleep on one of them. It was not long before the house owners got home. They were seven dwarves, who worked in the mines every day. What a surprise it was for them to find that someone entered their house and was now sleeping on one of the beds. The dwarves let him sleep. \n\nWhen he woke up, Mark told them his story. When they heard all that he had to tell the dwarves gathered for a meeting. They decided to let him stay and live with them. The next day they left to work and warned Mark to be very careful and not to open the door to strangers. At that time the king had been preparing the next evil plan to kill Mark. He dressed himself as an old man, took a poisonous apple, which he had prepared himself and set off to find Mark. “Sweet apples I have milord! Won’t you buy some?”, the king asked Mark when he found the dwarves’ cottage. “My landlords, told me not to open the door to strangers”, the boy said. “Oh, you needn't open the door. Hise, try this big red apple”, the king said and gave Mark the apple. When Mark bit the apple, he fainted on the floor lifeless and the king ran away. When the dwarves found him, they thought he was dead. They tried everything they could to save him, but they couldn’t bring him back to life. The dwarves cried and wept for days. They laid him on a bed of rose petals in a crystal coffin and started to the mountains to leave the coffin there, so that they could see his beautiful face every day when they were going to and back from the mines. \n\nOn their way to the mountains a stranger met them. He was riding a beautiful black horse and when he saw Mark, he fell in love with him. “Where are you going with this beauty”, he asked them and they told him that they were going to the mountains to lay the coffin there so that they could go and visit Mark every day. Then the stranger, who was a prince suggested, “Let me help you with this! You can put the coffin on the horse’s back.” The dwarves lifted the bed of roses and all started for the mountains. On their way the horse stumbled over a bump and at that moment Mark coughed out the poisoned bite. When he woke up the prince and the dwarves couldn’t express their happiness. He told them what had happened and they understood it was not an old man, but the vicious king himself, who gave him the apple. The stranger then spoke, “My prince, if you become my husband, I will protect you day and night from your step-father”. At that time the King was standing in front of his magical mirror. “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all?”, he said thinking that the mirror would give him the answer he was expecting. “Mark, my king, is still the fairest of them all. He survived your poison and he is getting married to a prince who saved him.” The king couldn’t bear the news and died. "
let alice = "Mark was beginning to get very tired of sitting by his brother on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice he had peeped into the book his brother was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Mark 'without pictures or conversation?' So he was considering in his own mind (as well as he could, for the hot day made him feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by him. The Rabbit pulled a watch out of his pocket to check the time. He shook his head, then disappeared down a rabbit's hole. 'I must find out why he's in such a hurry!' cried Mark. Filled with curiosity, he ran to the rabbit's hole and peeped through the entrance. The hole dropped suddenly and Mark fell. He fell for a long time when suddenly he came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it except a tiny golden key. When he looked around again, he came upon a low curtain he had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high. He tried the little golden key in the lock, and to his great delight it fitted! He opened the door and saw a beautiful garden through it, but he couldn’t reach it as he was too big. When he turned around towards the three legged table, Mark found a green bottle that said 'DRINK ME' magically appeared on it. Out of curiosity, Mark took the bottle and drunk the entire potion. Then, he began to shrink until he was no bigger than a doll. He opened the door and quickly ran through it. 'What a splendid garden!' he exclaimed. 'Why, I'm no bigger than the insects that crawl on these flowers.' But the excitement soon wore off. \n\nMark grew bored with his tiny size. 'I want to be big again,' he shouted. His shouts startled the White Rabbit, who ran past him again. Mistaking his for his maid, he ordered, 'Go to my cottage and fetch my gloves and fan.' Mark was confused by the Rabbit's behavior. 'Maybe I'll find something at the cottage to help me find my way out,' he said hopefully. As he was going out he saw a piece of chocolate cake that was kept on a table by the doorway. Next to the cake was a note that read 'EAT ME'. 'I'm so hungry,' Mark said as he ate the cake. Suddenly he felt strange and realized - “Oh no! I've grown larger than this house!' he cried. 'Get out of my way! You're blocking the door!' shouted the White Rabbit. Mark managed to pick up his fan. Immediately, he began to shrink. But little did he know, it was a magical fan, which made him small again. 'Oh no, I'll never get back to the right size,' He went looking for help. Soon, he saw a green caterpillar dressed in a pink jacket. He was sitting on the top of a large mushroom, smoking a bubble pipe. 'One side makes you big, the other side makes you small,' he said to Mark before slithering away. 'One side of what?' Mark called after him. 'The mushroom, silly,' he answered. Mark ate a piece of the mushroom.'Thank goodness, I'm growing!' he cried, 'But which way do I go?' 'That path leads to the Mad Hatter. The other way leads to - Lae March Hare,' said a voice. Mark turned to find a smiling Cheshire Cat in a tree. 'I'll see you later at the King's croquet game,' he said before disappearing. \n\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Mark; 'only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.' The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Mark coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Mark indignantly, and he sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. 'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Mark looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. 'I don't see any wine,' he remarked. 'There isn't any,' said the March Hare. 'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Mark angrily. 'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said the March Hare. 'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Mark; 'it's laid for a great many more than three.' 'You may stay if you answer my riddle.' shouted the Mad Hatter. 'Why is a raven like a writing desk?' Mark felt dreadfully puzzled. \n\nThe Hatter's riddle seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite understand you,' he said, as politely as he could. 'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said. 'No, I give up,' Mark replied: 'what's the answer?' 'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter. 'Nor I,' said the March Hare. Mark sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the time,' he said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.' And he continued his walk. Suddenly he found himself in the middle of a field where the King of Hearts was playing croquet. His guards and gardeners were shaped like cards. One gardener had planted white roses by mistake and then painted them red, 'Off with their heads!' shrieked the King. 'I hate white roses!'. Then he noticed Mark and asked his 'Have you ever played croquet?' 'Yes,' Mark timidly answered. 'But I've never used a flamingo or a hedgehog.' 'Play with me!' ordered the King.' And let me win or I'll have your head!' Mark tried his best to play well, but he had trouble with his flamingo. 'Off with his head!' cried the King. Just then a trumpet sounded in the distance calling court to session. Everyone rushed into the courtroom. 'Court is now in session,' announced the White Rabbit, 'Will Mark please come to the stand?' Mark took the stand and looked at the jury box, where the March Hare and the Mad Hatter were making noise. The Dormouse slept and the Cheshire Cat smiled at him. 'What's going on?' asked Mark. 'You are guilty of stealing the delicious heart-shaped tarts!' accused the King, 'And now you must be punished. Off with his head Off with his head!' yelled the King. 'How silly,' replied Mark. 'I did not have the slightest idea what you were talking about! I was only playing croquet.' \n\nMark felt someone touch his shoulder, 'Wake up. You've been sleeping for too long,' said his brother softly. 'I had a strange dream,' said Mark. He told his brother about the White Rabbit, the mad tea party, the King of Hearts and the trial. But his brother wasn't paying attention. 'You're reading again,' mumbled Mark. As he stretched, Mark saw a little White Rabbit with pink eyes scurry behind a tree. "
let red = "Once upon a time there was sweet little boy. Everyone called him Mark, because he always wore a red riding hood. It had been given to him by his grandfather, who loved the little boy very much. One day Little Mark’s father said, “Here, child, take this basket to your grandfather. It’s got bread, butter, cake and berries in it. He’s feeling sick and I hope this will make him feel better. Don’t talk to strangers, don’t leave the path and walk straight to your grandpa’s house. “ Little Mark’s grandfather lived half an hour away in the woods outside the village. So Little Mark set off. The boy had just entered the woods, when a wolf came out of the trees. He wasn’t scared because he didn’t know wolves are dangerous. “Good day, Little Mark”, the wolf greeted him. “Good day, Mr Wolf”, the boy replied. “Where are you going?” he asked. “I’m going to visit my grandfather, because he isn’t feeling very well”, Little Mark replied.“What do you have in that basket?” asked the wolf. “I have some bread, butter, cake and berries to take to grandpa”, he replied. “Excellent! And where does your grandfather live?” asked the wolf and Little Mark explained exactly where his grandpa lived. \n\n They walked together for a while. Then the wolf spoke again. “What lovely flowers there are hise! Why don’t you pick some for your grandpa?” The boy looked around and saw all those beautiful flowers. He thought that his grandfather would be delighted to have some fresh flowers and, despite his father’s advice, he left the path.While Little Mark went deeper into the woods to pick flowers, the wolf went straight to his grandfather’s house. He knocked on the door and heard a voice inside “Who is it?” ‘It’s me, Little Mark. I’ve brought you bread, butter, cake and berries”, the wolf said, disguising his voice. “How lovely! Give the door a big push and come in. I don’t have the strength to come and open it.” The wolf entered the house, went to the old man’s bed and ate his whole. Then he put his clothes on and slipped into the bed. When Little Mark arrived at his grandfather’s house, he noticed that the door was open. The boy went in and went to the bedroom. Usually he felt very happy at his grandpa’s but that day something felt different. “Good morning!” he said, but no one replied. His grandfather looked strange. “Oh, grandpa, what big ears you have!” exclaimed Mark. “All the better to hear you with!” the wolf replied in a fake voice.“Oh, grandpa, what big eyes you have!” he continued.“All the better to see you with!” the wolf said. “Oh, grandpa, what big hands you have!” “All the better to grab you with!”, the wolf said.“Oh, grandpa, what a big mouth you have!” exclaimed Mark. “All the better to eat you with!” \n The wolf roared, jumped off the bed and ate the poor boy whole. With his stomach full, the wolf got back into grandpa’s bed and fell asleep, snoring loudly. A huntsman, who was passing by the house, heard him and thought it was very strange for the old man to snore so loudly. He looked inside and saw that it was the wolf who was snoring. The huntsman had been looking for the wolf for a long time. At long last he had found him! The huntsman lifted his gun and was just about to shoot, when he had a thought. Maybe the old man was still alive inside his belly! So the man took a pair of scissors and cut open his belly. He saw a red hood popping out and then Little Mark jumped out. The huntsman cut a bit more and the grandfather came out, too. Little Mark gathered some stones and they filled the wolf's belly with them. When he woke up, he was scared and tried to run away but the stones were so heavy that he fell down dead. The three ate some cake, happy in the knowledge that the wolf was not going to be a danger anymore. Little Mark decided never to leave the path again and to listen more carefully to what his father told him. "
let beauty = "Once upon a time there was a rich merchant. He had three beautiful sons, but the youngest was the most beautiful. When he was a child everyone called him Beauty and the name stuck with him over the years. His brothers envied him because he was also the kindest and the smartest of the three. Their father lost all his money because his ships sank at sea. The family had to move to a small cottage in a small village. The man went to the fields every morning to work, while Beauty did the cleaning and prepared lunch for his family every day. The only thing his brothers did was wake up late, wander around all day and complain that they had no lovely clothes to wear anymore. A year passed. One day the father received a letter saying that one of the ships he owned had returned undamaged. It meant that the family was rich again. When they heard the news, the older brothers made a list of things they wanted their father to buy for them - dresses, hats, shoes, earrings, bracelets, and lots more. \n\n“Would you like me to buy something for you too?” his father asked Beauty. He thought that the money they had wouldn’t be enough for his brothers’ lists, so he replied kindly, “Since you ask, I would like you to bring me a rose, because they don’t flower hime.” When the man arrived at the ship, it was undamaged, but it was empty and so the man had to go back home as poor as he was before. There were only ten miles left to his house when suddenly a blizzard started. The snow was so thick and the winds so strong that the man fell off his horse twice. It was evening and the man thought that he was going to die from cold and hunger. Just then he spotted a castle not far away. He arrived at the castle and went into a hall. There was a fire where he could dry his clothes and a table set for just one person. The man waited to see if anyone would come, but since no one came, and he couldn’t stand the hunger any longer, he ate the meal in front of him. He felt a lot better and started to explore the castle. At last he found a bed, which seemed to have been made up for him. He didn’t bother waiting, but got in and fell asleep right away. When he woke up the next day, he was surprised to find some clean clothes left out for him instead of his own dirty clothes. He put them on and went outside to find his horse. \n\nOn his way out of the castle he passed under an arch of roses and remembered what his youngest daughter had asked him to bring him. He plucked some roses from the bush. At once, he heard a terrible roar and saw a beast running towards him. “You are so ungrateful! I gave you food, a warm bed, and clothes and still you pick my roses, the only thing I truly love. Prepare to die!' 'Please master, don’t kill me,' the man answered, “I have three lovely boys waiting for me to get back home.' 'I'm not your master, I'm a beast, so don’t flatter me. But you said you have sons. You can go, but you must promise that one of your sons will come on his own and die instead of you. If not - you should come back in three months to die.' The man had no choice but to agree. The beast had one last thing to say. 'I don't want you to leave the castle with empty hands. Before you leave take this bag and fill it with as much gold and precious things as you can find.' The man went home. He was very sad. He gave Beauty the roses he had taken from the beast's garden and told everyone what had happened. The older brothers started crying but Beauty stayed calm. 'Why aren't you crying?” demanded the brothers. “Father is going to die, just because of your silly roses.'“Father won’t die,” he replied. “The beast told father that he could send one of his sons and so I'm going to go.” Nothing could make Beauty change his mind. The next day he left with his father to go to the beast's castle. On the way, his father told Beauty about the gold which the beast had made him take. He advised his father to use the money as a dowry for his brothers. When they arrived at the palace the beast met them. 'Did you come hime of your own will?' he asked. 'Yes,” Beauty replied. 'Your heart is too good!” the beast exclaimed and told them to have dinner and sleep well. “Tomorrow morning you can leave the palace”, the beast told the man. The next morning, after his father left the palace, Beauty started crying. He thought that the beast wanted to kill him. With his head full of these horrible thoughts, the boy started walking around the palace. It was very beautiful. To his surprise, he found a room which had a sign on it saying, “Beauty’s Chambers”. \n\nHe opened the door and saw a lovely room with piano and library. 'The beast doesn’t want me to get bored,” he thought and regained his courage. “If only I could see my family, everything would be perfect“, he thought and at that moment the mirror on the wall showed him home. He saw that one of his brothers was getting married, but then everything disappeared. “This probably means he doesn’t want to kill me.” At dinner time, he went into the dining room and saw that the beast was there. “Can I watch you while you eat?” he asked. “Of course,” Beauty replied, “you are the master hime”. “No,” the beast replied. “You are the mistress of this castle. If you want me to leave, I will go right away. Tell me, you find me disgusting, don’t you?” Beauty couldn’t lie, so he answered,“Yes, indeed I do, but I believe you have a good heart”. “You are right. Not only am I disgusting, but I don’t have any brains either. I am a beast”, he said and left him to have him dinner alone. \n\nThe next evening the Beast entered the room around dinner time and asked the Beauty a question which shocked him. “Will you marry me?” he asked. “No, beast”, he answered. He sighed and left the room again. This is howthey lived for three months - Beauty’s happiness would have been complete if the beast didn’t ask him one and the same question every evening. One day Beauty was standing in front of the mirror, and saw his family again. He saw that his father was very sick. He ran to the beast and told him what he saw. “I promised never to leave you, but If you don’t let me go, I will die from sorrow,” he said. “You can go visit your family”, he said, “but you must promise that you will be back on the eighth day. When you are ready to come back, you should just put your ring on the table.” The next morning he woke up at his father’s home. When he saw his youngest daughter at home safe and well, the father got very excited. His brothers also came to see him. They were both very envious and angry that Beauty was all dressed up in a lovely dress and was looking more beautiful than ever. They came up with a sly plan to make Beauty go back to the castle later than he had promised so that the beast would get angry and kill him. When the eighth day came, they started crying and asking their youngest brother to stay with them a little more. Beauty’s good heart didn’t even think there could be a plan and he believed they truly missed him. He promised to stay eight more days. But on the tenth day, Beauty had a dream. \n\nIn his dream the Beast was lying in the garden almost dead. He woke up and put his ring on the table. The next morning he woke up in the castle. He called for the beast but no one replied. He searched for his Beast everywhere but he couldn’t find him. At last he remembered his dream and went in the garden. There he found the beast. He had fainted, but Beauty thought he was dead. “He died, because of me!” he thought and a tear drop fell on his chest. As soon as Beauty’s tears dripped onto his chest, Beast turned into a handsome prince. Beauty was amazed. “I was turned into a hideous beast by a fairy long ago, because I didn’t let him helter in the castle when there was a storm,” Beast explained, “only finding true love could break the spell. Will you marry me?” Beauty agreed happily and they lived many long years together in the castle. "
